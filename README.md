- It's written in TypeScript (Deno)
- It compiles to TypeScript (Deno)

## Demo & grammar

This is a simple `Hello, World!` program written in LiteScript:

```
use std

fn main() => std::res {
  std::io::write("Hello, World!")
  return std::res::ok
}
```

## Info

This is a toy programming language I made for my personal enjoyment. It is not made for real usage and is subject to change.
